<p>The best drink in the western spiral arm of the galaxy (reprinted with permission from Zaphod Beeblebrox)</p>

<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
  </li>Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit.
  </li>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V
  </li>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).
  </li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it (in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia).
  </li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones.
  </li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian suns deep into the heart of the drink.
  </li>Sprinkle Zamphour.
  </li>Add an olive.
  </li>Drink...but very carefully.
</ol>
